# SNAP & GO
> Team of five senior undergraduates developing a cross-platform mobile application which aims to improve productivity in the fast growing industry of arts and crafts!
## Project Summary
> Our team aims to improve productivity and imaginative thinking in arts and crafts by minimizing the amount of time most people use up searching for materials they need or inspiration from related projects. If you are looking for certain materials you need or if you simply need some motivation to build a piece of art with the materials readily available to you, just take a picture of it with our app! Using Google's state of the art image recognition software, we are able to detect *almost* all objects relating to arts and crafts. We then send this information to our server to quickly traverse stored websites and get you the best offers on materials and the coolest projects created by arts and crafters like yourself to help build your motivation to keep on creating! Users are also able to create accounts to store previous searches and share your projects with other users. No need to worry about information leaks, our team makes sure to use complex encryption to keep your information safe.
